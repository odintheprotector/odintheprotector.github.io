Hi guys, this time I joined UIUCTF 2024 and we got 28th place, and happier that we really defeated Emu Exploit üòÇüòÇüòÇ. This is a huge victory for us, and now it's my writeup for SoMesint series, let's go!

### Hip With the Youth

Notice to detail, you can see that they wanted us to find information in LISA instagram. Not waiting, I accessed to Instagram, searched "LISA" keyword and I got this:

Navigated to their profile, I checked 2 newest posts but there're nothing, and I saw a [Threads link](https://www.threads.net/@longislandsubwayauthority?xmt=AQGzjeNCfiZJXho_Kr9yrhUmSRyEW46pHNwtP9ETNscl6wA) in their profile:

Followed it, reloaded the site, and I saw a suspicious post: "**I've been told if I include a flag with my post I'll get more engagement, well here goes nothing!**". Clicked for more details, and I found the flag:

**Flag: uiuctf{7W1773r_K!113r_321879}**

### An Unlikely Partnership

Continued to dig deeper, in Threads profile, I found a [LinkedIn link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/long-island-subway-authority/):

Searched a bit and I found that in Skills category, there's 1 endorsement in Transportation, checked it and I found a profile:

I went to his profile and I found the flag:

### The Weakest Link

While I found the flag for **An Unlikely Partnership**, I also found an important information:

I knew that he had a Spotify account and he attached it to his profile, and I found his Spotify account in **Contact info**:

I tried to search carefully each playlist, but it seems not easy as I thought. Until I read the detail in LinkedIn profile again, I noticed a string: **I love music! I quite literally play it at all times**. I thought maybe there's a playlist that he always played it, so I tried to look for his activity status, and I found a playlist that was running:

Navigated to it and I found the flag:
