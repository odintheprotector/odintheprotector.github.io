Hi guys, this time I played BITSCTF 2025 and I felt a bit disappointed this year since DFIR was easier than the previous year. Btw, those are very suitable for newbies, 
so I will write solutions for them. Let's go 

### virus-camp-1

In this challenge we have the .ad1 file which is an image file and we can open it by using FTK imager:

I searched a bit and found the suspicious VScode extension:

There's a comment in the file, decode base64 and I got the 1st flag:

**Flag: BITSCTF{H0w_c4n_vS_c0d3_l3t_y0u_publ1sh_m4l1cious_ex73nsi0ns_SO_easily??_5a7b336c}**

### virus-camp-2 

Now with the extension we found, we can see that it will decode another base64 string, I decoded it and got the malware: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9720f3a8-b5a1-41a7-8acd-51d10d8404b5)

```python
$password = "MyS3cr3tP4ssw0rd"
$salt = [Byte[]](0x01,0x02,0x03,0x04,0x05,0x06,0x07,0x08)
$iterations = 10000
$keySize = 32   
$ivSize = 16 

$deriveBytes = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes($password, $salt, $iterations)
$key = $deriveBytes.GetBytes($keySize)
$iv = $deriveBytes.GetBytes($ivSize)

$inputFile = "C:\\Users\\vboxuser\\Desktop\\flag.png"
$outputFile = "C:\\Users\\vboxuser\\Desktop\\flag.enc"

$aes = [System.Security.Cryptography.Aes]::Create()
$aes.Key = $key
$aes.IV = $iv
$aes.Mode = [System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode]::CBC
$aes.Padding = [System.Security.Cryptography.PaddingMode]::PKCS7

$encryptor = $aes.CreateEncryptor()

$plainBytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($inputFile)

$outStream = New-Object System.IO.FileStream($outputFile, [System.IO.FileMode]::Create)
$cryptoStream = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream($outStream, $encryptor, [System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStreamMode]::Write)

$cryptoStream.Write($plainBytes, 0, $plainBytes.Length)
$cryptoStream.FlushFinalBlock()

$cryptoStream.Close()
$outStream.Close()

Remove-Item $inputFile -Force
```

We can see that it will encrypt **flag.png** by using AES algorithm. Very simple we can write a small script to decrypt it: 

```python
import hashlib
import os
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Protocol.KDF import PBKDF2

password = b"MyS3cr3tP4ssw0rd"
salt = bytes([0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08])
iterations = 10000
key_size = 32
iv_size = 16

key_iv = PBKDF2(password, salt, dkLen=key_size + iv_size, count=iterations)
key = key_iv[:key_size]
iv = key_iv[key_size:]

input_file = "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Downloads\\flag.enc"
output_file = "C:\\Users\\Admin\\Downloads\\flag.png"

with open(input_file, "rb") as f:
    encrypted_data = f.read()
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
decrypted_data = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data)

pad_length = decrypted_data[-1]
decrypted_data = decrypted_data[:-pad_length]

with open(output_file, "wb") as f:
    f.write(decrypted_data)
```

Run it and you will get the flag:

**Flag: BITSCTF{h0pe_y0u_enj0yed_th1s_145e3f1a}**

That's all! I hope that my writeup could help someone who's feeling new about DFIR. Thank you very much and see you in the next post. Bye ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™
