Hi everyone, a few day ago, BITSCTF 2024 was celebrated and I got 19th place and I'm very happy because I solved all DFIR challenges which it's my strengths:<br><br>
![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/1.png)<br><br>

## Access Granted!
For the first challenge, they needed us to find MogamBro password which was using for many things:<br><br>
![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/2.png)<br><br>
At first I tried to extract SAM and SYSTEM and then I could use **samdump2** to extract all credentials from his machine, but I realised I was too overthinking :>.<br>
It's very simple, we have memory file, and we can use **volatility** to extract password using **windows.hashdump** plugin:<br><br>
![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/3.png)<br><br>
You can see password for user **mogambro** and you just crack it by [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/)<br><br>

## 0.69 Day
In this challenge, they asked us to find CVE of the exploit that hacker used to gain access to MogamBro's machine:<br><br>
![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/bonus.png)<br><br>
First, I checked cmdlog by **windows.cmdline** plugin. Look into the result, the most suspicious thing is WinRAR process:<br><br>
![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/5.png)<br>

Let's take the sample in ad1 file and analyze!<br>

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/bonus2.png)<br>

Unzip zip file, we will get **step.pdf.bat** and **step.pdf**:<br>

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/6.png)<br>

With bat file, it will:
- Run **lottery.exe** program which is very suspicious.
- Create an incognito tab and access the [Pastebin link](https://pastebin.com/mPvzn0AD). 
- Open secret.png.enc by notepad
- Create step.pdf and open it

Caculate MD5 sum of **lottery.exe** and then copy it to Virustotal, result is **MALICIOUS**. So I thought this was the reason that hacker can gain access to MogamBro machine. Do some researchs, I found a CVE related to WinRAR and its mechanism is very same with this. It's [CVE-2023-38831](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/exploring-winrar-vulnerability-cve-2023-38831/) **(to be more careful, you should check version of WinRAR)**.<br><br>
**FLAG: BITSCTF{CVE-2023-38831}**

## Lottery
In this challenge, our mission is deeping into the payload. As I said in the second challenge, we have **lottery.exe** which is very suspicious and we haven't analyzed it yet. 
According to Virustotal, this program is packed by Pyinstaller:<br>

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/8.png)<br>

It's very clear that we can unpack it by [Pyinstaller Extractor](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor). Do as instruction, we will get all files inside this exe:<br><br>
![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/9.png)<br>

And **lottery.pyc** is the most suspicious. Let's decompile it to see what inside!:
```
# uncompyle6 version 3.5.0
# Python bytecode 3.8 (3413)
# Decompiled from: Python 3.7.2 (default, Dec 29 2018, 06:19:36) 
# [GCC 7.3.0]
# Embedded file name: lottery.py
import os, tempfile
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad

def generate_key():
    key = os.urandom(32)
    fp = tempfile.TemporaryFile(mode='w+b', delete=False)
    fp.write(key)
    return key

if __name__ == '__main__':
    key = generate_key()
    file_path = 'secret.png'
    encrypt_file(file_path, key)
    print('Dear MogamBro, we are fucking your laptop with a ransomware & your secret image is now encrypted! Send $69M to recover it!')

```
In these codes, we can know the iv is **urfuckedmogambro** and it use AES algorithm to encrypt **secret.png**. 
Moreover, we know that key is random 32 bytes and it's written to Temp file. In my experience, a name of Temp file will be generated automatically, but in general file name always has string "tmp". So I checked Temp folder and I found a file has 32 bytes, and I'm sure that it's the key:<br>

Use CyberChef and import all things, I really decrypted successfully **secret.png.enc**:<br>

## I'm wired in

While I solve the third challenge, I found **keylog.pcapng** in **Desktop** and I'm sure this is what this challenge want me to solve. Open it by Wireshark, we can see that it's record of USB traffic:<br>

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/15.png)<br>

You can see so many **URB_INTERRUPT in** packets. Refer to the [USB Keyboard data packet format](https://wiki.osdev.org/USB_Human_Interface_Devices), you can know that the first byte of each packet corresponds to the state of the control key, and the third Byte corresponds to the input key. From here I decided to extract all USBHID data and write a small Python script to decrypt it:
```
usb_codes = {
        0x04:"aA", 0x05:"bB", 0x06:"cC", 0x07:"dD", 0x08:"eE", 0x09:"fF",
        0x0A:"gG", 0x0B:"hH", 0x0C:"iI", 0x0D:"jJ", 0x0E:"kK", 0x0F:"lL",
        0x10:"mM", 0x11:"nN", 0x12:"oO", 0x13:"pP", 0x14:"qQ", 0x15:"rR",
        0x16:"sS", 0x17:"tT", 0x18:"uU", 0x19:"vV", 0x1A:"wW", 0x1B:"xX",
        0x1C:"yY", 0x1D:"zZ", 0x1E:"1!", 0x1F:"2@", 0x20:"3#", 0x21:"4$",
        0x22:"5%", 0x23:"6^", 0x24:"7&", 0x25:"8*", 0x26:"9(", 0x27:"0)",
        0x2C:"  ", 0x2D:"-_", 0x2E:"=+", 0x2F:"[{", 0x30:"]}",  0x32:"#~",
        0x33:";:", 0x34:"'\"",  0x36:",<",  0x37:".>"
}
data = ''
for x in open("bruh.txt","r").readlines():
        code = int(x[4:6],16)
        print(x[4:6])
        if code == 0:
                continue
        if code == 0x28:
                print('ENTER!')
                print(data)
                data = ''
                continue
        upper = 0
        if int(x[0:2],16) == 0x02 or int(x[0:2],16) == 0x20:
                upper = 1
        data += usb_codes[code][upper]
print(data)
```
Run it and you will get the flag:<br>

**FLAG: BITSCTF{I_7h1nk_th3y_4Re_k3yl0991ng_ME!}**

## MogamBro's guilty pleasure
In my opinion this is the most interesting challenge in DFIR. Our mission is analyzing email file in somewhere in backup file. After spending time finding, I found email files:<br>

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/17.png)<br>

I will use Thunderbird to analyze it! 

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/18.png)<br>

With **'YOU WON A LOTTERY.eml'** it just two files that I discussed above, so it's no more important. Just **'50% Discount available on the Mimikyu plushie.eml'** that we haven't analyzed yet:<br>

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/19.png)<br>

It took me a long time to think because 2 email don't give me anything. But when I read message so many times, I realised that it's so confusing and it's not how a normal person says. 
And then I thought: "Maybe... it's a type of encryption?????". Not waiting, I took a part of the message and search Google, I know it's called **Spammimic**:<br>

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/20.png)<br>

Very fast, I decoded message by [online tool](https://www.spammimic.com/decode.shtml) and I got the flag!

**FLAG: BITSCTF{sp4m_2_ph1sh_U}**

## Bypassing Transport Layer
This is the last challenge of DFIR, which asked you to find another TCP connection that gain access to MogamBro machine. 
Remember that we have **trace.pcap** and it's not be analyzed:<br>

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/21.png)<br>

First, to know what's another TCP connection, I need to know how many connections are there, so I checked in memory file by **windows.netscan** plugins:<br>

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/22.png)<br>

After that, you will check each connections, but these addresses are HTTP2, so their requests and responses are encrypted. 
To decrypt it we need key, and fortunately I found it in **Desktop** which is same directory with **keylog.pcapng**:<br>

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/23.png)<br>

Now go to **Edit -> Preferences... -> Protocols -> Find TLS -> Import key -> Reload pcapng/pcap file**. 
And now we can read HTTP2/TLS packets, return to our mission, we need to read each connections to see if connections is suspicious and not in result of netscan. 
It took me a lot of time, and I found a connection which is not in netscan and it contains many pastebin links, also the flag 😂:<br>

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bitsctf2024/24.png)<br>

**FLAG: BITSCTF{5te4l1ng_pr1v47e_key5_ez:) }**

This is all writeup for DFIR challenges. Last words, thank you BITSCTF for great CTF and great challenges! ❤️❤️❤️
